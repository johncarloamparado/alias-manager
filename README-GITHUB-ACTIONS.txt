ALIAS MANAGER PWA — GITHUB ACTIONS PACKAGE BUILDER

IMPORTANT
This project is a static Progressive Web App (PWA), not a native Android project.
The workflow packages the PWA files into a downloadable ZIP. It does NOT create an APK
and it does NOT publish/host the app on a public website.

HOW TO USE
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repository root. Make sure the .github/workflows/build.yml file is included.
3. Commit/push to the main or master branch, or open Actions and run “Build Alias Manager PWA” using Run workflow.
4. Open the completed workflow run in the Actions tab.
5. Download the artifact named “alias-manager-pwa” from the Artifacts section.
6. Inside it, alias-manager-pwa.zip contains the PWA files.

FILES REQUIRED
- index.html
- manifest.json
- sw.js
- icon-192.png
- icon-512.png
- .github/workflows/build.yml

NO HOSTING
GitHub Actions only builds/packages files. It does not make the app accessible at a public URL.
You can download the ZIP and use it locally or upload it to a host later if you choose.

APK NOTE
To produce an installable Android APK, the project needs an Android wrapper/build setup (for example, Capacitor with an Android project). This workflow intentionally does not claim to build an APK.
